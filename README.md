# Sandbox

:coffee: Just messin' around :coffee:

Sandbox environment for deploying AWS resources via Terraform and Github Actions.

#### Notes
Currently tracking the remote backend resources within this project for a quick setup (applied the bucket locally), but in "real world" project we would NOT want that.

#### To-Do:
* `action.yml` composite action for code reusability in github workflow.
